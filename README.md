# **Predicting Film Profitability**

This portfolio project is a work in progress. Using a variety of publicly available data about tens of thousands of feature films, the goal is to design a machine learning algorithm (model) that can predict, as accurately as possible:  

**(1)** whether a film's global box office revenue exceeded (or will exceed) its budget, and  

**(2)** by how much its global box office exceeded (or will exceed) its budget (approximation of profits).  

Some additional goals are:  

**(3)** for the model's inputs to be simple and few enough so that it could be used to predict the profitability of a film that has not been made yet (making some assumptions about the unmade film's cast, crew and release), and  

**(4)** for the model to be interpretable, so users can get a sense of what factors make a film profitable vs. unprofitable.

This project is a work in progress. Using a variety of publicly available data about tens of thousands of feature films, the end goal is to design a machine learning algorithm that can predict:  

(1) whether a film's global box office revenue exceeded (or will exceed) its budget,  

(2) by how much its global box office exceeded (or will exceed) its budget (approximation of profits),  

(3) for the algorithm's inputs to be simple and few enough so that it could be used to predict the profitability of a film that has not been made yet, and  

(4) for the algorithm to be interpretable, so users can get a sense of what factors make a film profitable vs. unprofitable.
